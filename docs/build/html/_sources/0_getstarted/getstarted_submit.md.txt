# Submit your results

<br>  

If you have run at least one notebook for your method in one region of interest. You must have now (thanks to nbconvert in the last cell of the notebook) a markdown equivalent with an associated folder in the ```results/``` repository: 

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="../_static/dc_2024_WOC-ESA_submit_example.jpg" alt="Alt Text" width="500"/>
</p> 
      
<br>
 

<div class="alert alert-block alert-success">
<h4><center> You can submit your result by creating a pull request on GitHub to add the markdown and associated folder for your method. </center></h4>  
    
<br>

</div>    

<br>


NB: Please make sure the names are intelligible (i.e., nb_wocproducts_Agulhas_*yourmethod*.ipynb).
